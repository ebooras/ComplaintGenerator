# Random Complaint Generator
This Java app was a group project completed during my undergrad years. Our team was assigned to write an app that would generate a complaint to a fake restaurant by filling in pre-made templates Mad Libs-style. We used JavaFX to create the interface as well. My primary responsibility in this project was writing the code for replacing the words in each sentence and planning the structure of the app.

The twist was that, midway through the project, we had to switch code with another group doing the same project and finish working on the project with their code. Our original code is in the folder OriginalCGFiles.
